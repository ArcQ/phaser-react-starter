#createjs-react-starter

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). For more information on how to build the ui, please visit their readme.

The concept of this project revovles around using React for your ui and createjs for your game layer. Redux will be shared between the two layers for all common pieces of state.
The project was designed so that it would be easy to update to newer versions of create react app as well as being able to utilize the functionality that it will continue to bring in the future. 
Only npm run eject as a last case scenario.

Clone this repo and then do the following to get started:

```
